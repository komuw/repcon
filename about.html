            <h4>Mission and Vision:</h4>
            Repcon Associates is a Kenyan owned company fully registered under the Companies Act. <br />
            The name Repcon is an abbreviation for Resource and Environmental Planning Consulting Associates, which in a
            nutshell, captures the business focus for the company. <br />
            The company was founded and registered in 1998 with the aim of offering homegrown expertise and solutions to
            resource planning and environmental management challenges in Kenya and the Region. <br />
            Though registered in 1998, the firm brought together the cumulative experiences of the partners
            who had been in consultancy since the early 1990. <br />
            Originally established as a partnership operating from an apartment building, we have expanded to a
            fully-fledged consultancy firm located its own Training Resource Center at Muguga- the research capital of
            Kenya.<br />

            meet increasing demand, the firm has progressively expanded activities to cover the entire spectrum of
            Environment and Natural Resource Development. <br />
            Under this focus, we have specialized in provision of research, consultancy and training services for
            sustainable environmental management. The company maintains an up-to-date data bank comprising a wide
            selection of literature and data covering the entire realm of environmental practice including standards of
            quality and this guarantees quick synthesis and production of quality outputs and reports on any of the
            relevant sub-sectors.<br />
            Our firm therefore has all the necessary capacity to deliver and we are committed to satisfying our clients'
            requirements. <br />
            We adopt a participatory approach to all assignments to ensure that clients are satisfied and fully identify
            with the outputs.<br />
