            Environment and Development.<br />
            Our past involvement can be segregated into five broad but interrelated themes.<br /><br />

            <h4>1. Baseline Surveys:</h4> Our capability and excellence is in the range of Feasibility Studies and
            Appraisals for new projects, Baseline surveys among other activities towards identification and formulation
            of projects. A few illustrative examples are provided here below:-<br />

                    potential to arrest and reverse environmental degradation cycles currently widespread in the
                    ecologically fragile Drainage Basin Five in Kenya. The assignment was undertaken as part of the
                    Ewaso
